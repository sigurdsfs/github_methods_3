## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
lul <- function(n,grand_mean,indi_mean,grand_se,indi_se){
  ((n/indi_se*indi_mean)+(1/grand_se*grand_mean))/(n/indi_se+1/grand_se)
}
# j mean = 10    mean_all = 9

lul(1,8,10,2,2) # approach grand mean of 9 
lul(10,8,10,2,2) #approach 10
lul(1000000000,8,10,2,2) #becomes 10
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
