# Exercises and objectives
The objectives of the exercises of this assignment are:  
1) Download and organise the data and model and plot staircase responses based on fits of logistic functions  
2) Fit multilevel models for response times  
3) Fit multilevel models for count data  

REMEMBER: In your report, make sure to include code that can reproduce the answers requested in the exercises below (__MAKE A KNITTED VERSION__)  
REMEMBER: This assignment will be part of your final portfolio

## Exercise 1

Go to https://osf.io/ecxsj/files/ and download the files associated with Experiment 2 (there should be 29).  
The data is associated with Experiment 2 of the article at the following DOI https://doi.org/10.1016/j.concog.2019.03.007  

1) Put the data from all subjects into a single data frame  
```{r}
pacman::p_load(readbulk, tidyverse, lmerTest, lme4, rstanarm)
df_exp <- readbulk::read_bulk("experiment_2", extension = ".csv")
```

2) Describe the data and construct extra variables from the existing variables  
    i. add a variable to the data frame and call it _correct_ (have it be a _logical_ variable).
Assign a 1 to each row where the subject indicated the correct answer and a 0 to each row where the subject indicated the incorrect answer (__Hint:__ the variable _obj.resp_ indicates whether the subject answered "even", _e_ or "odd", _o_, and the variable _target_type_ indicates what was actually presented.
```{r i.}


df_exp <- df_exp %>% 
  mutate(right_answer = if_else(target.type == "odd" & obj.resp == "o" | target.type == "even" & obj.resp == "e",1,0)) %>% 
  mutate(right_answer = as.numeric(right_answer))

df_exp <- df_exp %>% 
  mutate(right_answer = as.factor(right_answer)) %>% 
  mutate(subject = as.factor(subject)) %>% 
  mutate(task = as.factor(task)) %>% 
  mutate(target.type = as.factor (target.type))

sum(is.na(df_exp) == TRUE)
```

    ii. describe what the following variables in the data frame contain, _trial.type_, _pas_, _trial_, _target.contrast_, _cue_, _task_, _target_type_, _rt.subj_, _rt.obj_, _obj.resp_, _subject_ and _correct_. (That means you can ignore the rest of the variables in your description). For each of them, indicate and argue for what `class` they should be classified into, e.g. _factor_, _numeric_ etc. 
```{r}
```

** trial.type **: Contains two levels - staircase and experiment. The staircase trials are made as a way of adjusting the target.contrast. A 75% accuracy was aimed for. The experiment trials are what the actual experiment consists of (factor)
** pas **: Perceptual awareness scale. Subjective rating of the experience of awareness of the stimulus.Ranging from 1 (no experience) to 4 (clear experience) (numeric)
** trial **: Trial number, resets when trial.type changes (numeric)
** target.contrast **: The contrast of the target stimulus relative to the background (numeric)
** cue **: An indicator of which set of cue stimuli was used ranging from 0 to 35 (factor)
** task **: Indication of if the cue was shown as singles, pairs or quadruplets (factor)
** target_type **: Showing if the target variable is odd or even (factor)
** rt.subj **: Reaction time on subjective rating (numeric)
** rt.obj **: Task reaction time in milliseconds (numeric)
** obj.resp **: The response given by the participant, e.g. even or odd (factor)
** subject **: Participant ID (factor)
** correct **: Indicating whether participants answered correctly (factor)


    iii. for the staircasing part __only__, create a plot for each subject where you plot the estimated function (on the _target.contrast_ range from 0-1) based on the fitted values of a model (use `glm`) that models _correct_ as dependent on _target.contrast_. These plots will be our _no-pooling_ model. Comment on the fits - do we have enough data to plot the logistic functions? 
```{r}
m1 <- glm(right_answer ~ target.contrast*subject, data = filter(df_exp,trial.type == "staircase" ), family = binomial(link = "logit")) 


invlogit(coef(m1))


df_exp_stair <- df_exp %>%
  filter(trial.type == "staircase") %>% 
  mutate(fit_value = fitted.values(m1))

df_exp_stair %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = target.contrast, y = fit_value)) + geom_point() + facet_wrap(~subject)
```
    
    iv. on top of those plots, add the estimated functions (on the _target.contrast_ range from 0-1) for each subject based on partial pooling model (use `glmer` from the package `lme4`) where unique intercepts and slopes for _target.contrast_ are modelled for each _subject_ 
```{r}
m2 <- glmer(right_answer ~ target.contrast + (1+target.contrast|subject), data = df_exp_stair, family = binomial(link = "logit"))
summary(m2)



```


```{r}
df_exp_stair <- df_exp_stair %>% 
  mutate(partial_fit_val = fitted.values(m2))

df_exp_stair %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = target.contrast, y = partial_fit_val)) + geom_point() + geom_point(aes(x = target.contrast, y = fit_value, col = "green")) + facet_wrap(~subject)
```

    v. in your own words, describe how the partial pooling model allows for a better fit for each subject 

    

## Exercise 2

Now we __only__ look at the _experiment_ trials (_trial.type_)  
```{r}
df_exp_exp <- df_exp %>% 
  filter(trial.type == "experiment")
```


1) Pick four subjects and plot their Quantile-Quantile (Q-Q) plots for the residuals of their objective response times (_rt.obj_) based on a model where only intercept is modelled. 
```{r}
m3 <- lmer(rt.obj ~ (1|subject), data = df_exp_exp)

df_exp_exp <- df_exp_exp %>% 
  mutate(rt.obj_fit_val = fitted(m3)) %>% 
  mutate(rt.obj_resid = resid(m3))
```


```{r}
#For-loop not printing out plot.. Don't know why as I've done similair loops before. 
for (i in sample(1:length(unique(df_exp_exp$subject)),4)){
  df_exp_exp %>%
    filter(subject == as.character(i)) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(sample = rt.obj_resid)) + stat_qq()+stat_qq_line()
}
```


```{r}
#Boring tedious way
subjects <- sample(1:length(unique(df_exp_exp$subject)),4)
```


```{r}
df_exp_exp %>%
  filter(subject == as.character(subjects[1])) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(sample = rt.obj_resid)) + stat_qq() + stat_qq_line() + labs(title = paste("Residual plot for subject", subjects[1],sep = " "))
                                                                         
df_exp_exp %>%
  filter(subject == as.character(subjects[2])) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(sample = rt.obj_resid)) + stat_qq() + stat_qq_line() + labs(title = paste("Residual plot for subject", subjects[2],sep = " "))
df_exp_exp %>%
  filter(subject == as.character(subjects[3])) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(sample = rt.obj_resid)) + stat_qq() + stat_qq_line() + labs(title = paste("Residual plot for subject", subjects[3],sep = " "))
df_exp_exp %>%
  filter(subject == as.character(subjects[4])) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(sample = rt.obj_resid)) + stat_qq() + stat_qq_line() + labs(title = paste("Residual plot for subject", subjects[4],sep = " "))
```

    i. comment on these
The residuals does not look normally distributed some worse than others. As this is an 
assumption of the linear mixed-effect models measures to counteract is required. 

    ii. does a log-transformation of the response time data improve the Q-Q-plots?
```{r}
m4 <- lmer(log(rt.obj) ~ (1|subject), data = df_exp_exp)

df_exp_exp <- df_exp_exp %>% 
  mutate(rt.obj_fit_val_log = fitted(m4)) %>% 
  mutate(rt.obj_resid_log = resid(m4))
```


```{r}
#Boring tedious way with log
df_exp_exp %>%
  filter(subject == as.character(subjects[1])) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(sample = rt.obj_resid_log)) + stat_qq() + stat_qq_line() + labs(title = paste("Log Residual plot for subject", subjects[1],sep = " "))

df_exp_exp %>%
  filter(subject == as.character(subjects[2])) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(sample = rt.obj_resid_log)) + stat_qq() + stat_qq_line() + labs(title = paste("Log Residual plot for subject", subjects[2],sep = " "))
df_exp_exp %>%
  filter(subject == as.character(subjects[3])) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(sample = rt.obj_resid_log)) + stat_qq() + stat_qq_line() + labs(title = paste("Log Residual plot for subject", subjects[3],sep = " "))
df_exp_exp %>%
  filter(subject == as.character(subjects[4])) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(sample = rt.obj_resid_log)) + stat_qq() + stat_qq_line() + labs(title = paste("Log Residual plot for subject", subjects[4],sep = " "))
```
It generally generated some better QQ-plots for some of the subjects. But there 
are still some inconsistency leaving some of the QQ-plots still showing skewness.  

2) Now do a partial pooling model modelling objective response times as dependent on _task_? (set `REML=FALSE` in your `lmer`-specification)  
```{r}
m5 <- lmer(rt.obj ~ task + (1|subject) + (1|pas), data = df_exp_exp, REML = FALSE)
summary(m5)
MuMIn::r.squaredGLMM(m5)
```

    i. which would you include among your random effects and why? (support your choices with relevant measures, taking into account variance explained and number of parameters going into the modelling)
```{r}
partpoolm1.1 <- lmer(log(rt.obj) ~ task + (1 | subject), data = df_exp_exp, REML=FALSE)
partpoolm1.2 <- lmer(log(rt.obj) ~ task + (1 | trial), data = df_exp_exp, REML=FALSE)
partpoolm1.3 <- lmer(log(rt.obj) ~ task + (1 | trial)+ (1|subject), data = df_exp_exp, REML=FALSE)
partpoolm1.4 <- lmer(log(rt.obj) ~ task + (1 + task | subject), data = df_exp_exp, REML=FALSE)
partpoolm1.5 <- lmer(log(rt.obj) ~ task + (1 + task | subject) + (1 | trial), data = df_exp_exp, REML = F)
```


```{r}
anova(partpoolm1.1,partpoolm1.2,partpoolm1.3,partpoolm1.4,partpoolm1.5)
```
m1.3 and m1.5 both seem to perform well while this seem to be due to having random
intercept for both trial and subject. Adding a random slope of task for subjects
improves the model slightly following AIC. 

A random intercept for both task and subject is theoretically warranted as well 
as the effect of task being different between individuals. 

partpoolm1.5 is therefore selected. 
    
    ii. explain in your own words what your chosen models says about response times between the different tasks  
```{r}
summary(partpoolm1.5)
```
The estimated effect sizes for quadruplet and singles are negative, which indicates
that these tasks will result in lower reaction time compared to single_task.

3) Now add _pas_ and its interaction with _task_ to the fixed effects  

    i. how many types of group intercepts (random effects) can you add without ending up with convergence issues or singular fits?  
```{r}
partpoom2.1 <- lmer(log(rt.obj) ~ task*pas + (1|subject), data = df_exp_exp, REML = F)
partpoolm2.2 <- lmer(log(rt.obj) ~ task*pas + (1|trial) + (1|subject), data = df_exp_exp, REML = F)
partpoolm2.3 <- lmer(log(rt.obj) ~ task*pas + (1|trial) + (1|subject) +  (1|cue), data = df_exp_exp, REML = F)
partpoolm2.4 <- lmer(log(rt.obj) ~ task*pas + (1|trial) + (1|subject) +  (1|cue) + (1|target.contrast), data = df_exp_exp, REML = F)
```
When adding a fourth intercept an error occurs (singular fit)

    ii. create a model by adding random intercepts (without modelling slopes) that results in a singular fit - then use `print(VarCorr(<your.model>), comp='Variance')` to inspect the variance vector - explain why the fit is singular (Hint: read the first paragraph under details in the help for `isSingular`)'
```{r}
print(VarCorr(partpoolm2.4), comp='Variance')
```
Some of the variances approaches zero.

    iii. in your own words - how could you explain why your model would result in a singular fit?  
The model will give an error of "is singular" when the random effect's variance is nearly zero. Could be due to different things. Adding many random parameters will results in a model, where they each do NOT explain a lot of variance in the data. Or a certain selection of random effect is not warranted. It can also occur when the variables are highly correlated (i.e. correlation close to either -1 or 1). 
    
## Exercise 3

1) Initialise a new data frame, `data.count`. _count_ should indicate the number of times they categorized their experience as _pas_ 1-4 for each _task_. I.e. the data frame would have for subject 1: for task:singles, pas1 was used # times, pas2 was used # times, pas3 was used # times and pas4 was used # times. You would then do the same for task:pairs and task:quadruplet  

```{r}
## you can start from this if you want to, but you can also make your own from scratch
data.count <- data.frame(count = numeric(), 
                         pas = numeric(), ## remember to make this into a factor afterwards
                         task = numeric(), ## and this too
                         subject = numeric()) ## and this too
```        

```{r}
df_count <- df_exp %>% 
  group_by(subject, task, pas) %>% 
  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  mutate(pas = as.factor(pas))
```

2) Now fit a multilevel model that models a unique "slope" for _pas_ for each _subject_ with the interaction between _pas_ and _task_ and their main effects being modelled.
```{r}
m3.1 <- glmer(count ~ pas*task + (1+pas|subject), family = poisson(link = "log"), data = df_count)
summary(m3.1)
```

    i. which family should be used? 
Poisson which is basically a binomial logisitc regression where the boundaries
approaches/goes to 0. 

    ii. why is a slope for _pas_ not really being modelled?
Because pas i being treated as a factor we're not really modelling a slope but 
rather the differences between the levels of pas **compared to the first level.**  

    iii. if you get a convergence error, try another algorithm (the default is the _Nelder_Mead_) - try (_bobyqa_) for which the `dfoptim` package is needed. In `glmer`, you can add the following for the `control` argument: `glmerControl(optimizer="bobyqa")` (if you are interested, also have a look at the function `allFit`)
```{r}
pacman::p_load(dfoptim)
```
### Poison modeling
```{r}
m3.2 <- glmer(count ~ pas*task + (1+pas|subject), family = poisson(link = "log"),control = glmerControl(optimizer="bobyqa"),data = df_count)
summary(m3.2)
```

    iv. when you have a converging fit - fit a model with only the main effects of _pas_ and _task_. Compare this with the model that also includes the interaction  
```{r}
m3.3 <- glmer(count ~ pas+task + (1+pas|subject), family = poisson(link = "log"),control = glmerControl(optimizer="bobyqa"),data = df_count)
summary(m3.3)

```
    v. indicate which of the two models, you would choose and why 

First we will add another column containing the total number of counts in each 
grouping of participant and task. The log() verison of that column will work as
our **offset** variable in future models.  
```{r}
df_count <- df_count %>% 
  group_by(task,subject) %>% 
  mutate(total_count = sum(count))
```

### Modeling with offset    
Poission regression can either model count or rate data. So far we have modelled count data.
But our count data is a fraction of larger grouping or time interval. In our case
the frequency will be estimated within the grouping of task and subject. 
Subject 1 & task pairs has 170 data points where 4 of them is in pas = 4. The frequency 
is therefore 4/170. 

**Disclaimer**
I am not quite sure whether it is best practise to divide by subject in the grouping or 
if should only be done by task as we account for indivudial variance with the random effect of subject??? 

```{r}
m3.4 <- glmer(count ~ pas*task + (1+pas|subject), family = poisson(link = "log"),control = glmerControl(optimizer="bobyqa"),data = df_count, offset = log(total_count))
summary(m3.4)
```


```{r}
m3.5 <- glmer(count ~ pas+task + (1+pas|subject), family = poisson(link = "log"),control = glmerControl(optimizer="bobyqa"),data = df_count, offset = log(total_count))
summary(m3.5)
```
### Comparing interaction and offset models
```{r}
#check R^2
MuMIn::r.squaredGLMM(m3.2)
MuMIn::r.squaredGLMM(m3.3)
MuMIn::r.squaredGLMM(m3.4)
MuMIn::r.squaredGLMM(m3.5)
```


```{r}
#check with anova
anova(m3.2,m3.3,m3.4,m3.5)
```
The interaction effects are significant in both our model with and without offset.
As showed by our culminated R2 the interaction effect also adds a tiny bit of
explained variance while also performing better following AIC and BIC which punishes
unceccesary model complexity. 

The inclusion of an offset variable is theoretical warranted when working with
frequencies in poission regression as argued by Gelman and Hill in 
(Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models, 2007). 
The offset variable also shows a marginal improvement in AIC/BIC but with a enormous reduction in culminated R2. - HoweverI am not quite sure of R2 interpretation due to warning message. 

*My model of choice will be m3.4 as it contains the needed interaction effect and
offset variable will performing best on AIC and BIC.* 

```{r}
mean(df_count$count)
var(df_count$count)
```
as $mean \neq var $ this is an indication of that there will be overdispersion in all
our models. But as non of my known dispersiontest (If the Residual Deviance is greater than the degrees of freedom, then over-dispersion exists) and quasipoission distributions
work on mixed effect modelling I don't know what can be done about it. Ideally
something would be done like a quasipoission regression.  

    vi. based on your chosen model - write a short report on what this says about the distribution of ratings as dependent on _pas_ and _task_  
```{r}
ggplot(df_count, aes(col = pas, x = count)) + geom_density() + facet_wrap(~task)
```

```{r}
summary(m3.4)
```

```{r}
exp(fixef(m3.4))
```
- exp(Î±)= effect on the mean Î¼, when X = 0
- exp(Î²) = with every unit increase in X, the predictor variable has multiplicative effect of exp(Î²) on the mean of Y, that is Î¼

- If Î² = 0, then exp(Î²) = 1, and the expected count is exp(Î±) and, Y and X are not related.
- If Î² > 0, then exp(Î²) > 1, and the expected count is exp(Î²) times larger than when X = 0
- If Î² < 0, then exp(Î²) < 1, and the expected count is exp(Î²) times smaller than when X = 0


#### Pas fix
Pas2 will reduce the frequency of count by *(1-0.9725)* percentage compared to pas1. 
As shown by the exp(fixef(m3.4)) pas3 and pas4 will result in an even more drastic reduction compared to pas1. 

#### Task fix
Quadruplet will increase count frequency with *(1-1.11)* percentage compared to
task_pairs. Though task_singles decrease the frequency with *(1-0.78)* 
percentage compared to  task_pairs. 

#### Interaction effect
The interaction effects show that task_singles interaction with pas level 2:4
increase our frequency. While the interaction between task_quadruplet and pas
level 2:4 will significantly decrease our frequency. In a percentage wise interpretation 
the effect of some of the interactions are even larger than the fixed effects alone.
This is seems kinda odd as adding the interaction effect didn't improve the models
with a big margin. 




    vii. include a plot that shows the estimated amount of ratings for four subjects of your choosing 

As our current selected model is a model of frequency it wouldn't be fitting for 
plotting "amount". 
There the similair count model m3.2 without the offset is selected for this assigment.
```{r}
df_count_fil <- df_count %>% 
  filter(subject == '3' | subject == '7' | subject == '17' | subject == '28')


df_count_fil_pred <- cbind(df_count_fil, pred_val = exp(predict(m3.2, newdata = df_count_fil)))

ggplot(df_count_fil_pred, aes(x = pas, y = pred_val, fill = task)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity') + 
  facet_wrap(~ subject) + 
  theme_light()

```

    
3) Finally, fit a multilevel model that models _correct_ as dependent on _task_ with a unique intercept for each _subject_
Two options: 
  1) I could calculate the amount of corrects and do a poission regression on the 
  count or frequency of correct responses.
```{r}
#Something like this where I also add some of 
df_exp_count_correct <- df_exp %>% 
  group_by(subject,task,pas) %>%
  summarise(n_correct = sum(right_answer == 1)) 

df_exp_count_correct <- df_exp_count_correct %>% 
  group_by(subject) %>% 
  mutate(n_answers = sum(n_correct)) %>% 
  mutate(pas = as.factor(pas))
```

```{r}
model1_pois <- glmer(n_correct ~ task + (1|subject), data = df_exp_count_correct,
                offset = log(n_answers), family = poisson(link = "log"))
summary(model1_pois)
exp(fixef(model1_pois))
MuMIn::r.squaredGLMM(model1_pois)
```


  2) I could just do a normal binomial regression trying to predict correct. 
```{r}
model1_binom <- glmer(right_answer ~ task + (1|subject), data = df_exp,
                      family = binomial(link = "logit"))
summary(model1_binom)
invlogit(fixef(model1_binom))
MuMIn::r.squaredGLMM(model1_binom)
```
    i. does _task_ explain performance? 
Both models shows task significantly predicts right_answer. Binomial models shows
a rather lower R2c = 0.055 but the poisson model is attrosious. 

    ii. add _pas_ as a main effect on top of _task_ - what are the consequences of that?
Due to my time and your reading time I will only continue using the binomial approach. ;) 
```{r}
model2_binom <- glmer(right_answer ~ task + pas + (1|subject), data = df_exp,
                      family = binomial(link = "logit"))
summary(model2_binom)
invlogit(fixef(model2_binom))
MuMIn::r.squaredGLMM(model2_binom)
```
R2c has gotten a boost up to 0.31 from 0.055. The effect size of task_quadruplet 
and task_singles has almost remained the same but the is now no longer signifcant.
```{r}
anova(model1_binom, model2_binom)
```
Model 2 appears to be the best model. 

    iii. now fit a multilevel model that models _correct_ as dependent on _pas_ with a unique intercept for each _subject_
```{r}
model3_binom <- glmer(right_answer ~ pas + (1|subject), data = df_exp,
                      family = binomial(link = "logit"))
```


    iv. finally, fit a model that models the interaction between _task_ and _pas_  and their main effects  
```{r}
model4_binom <- glmer(right_answer ~ pas*task + (1|subject), data = df_exp,
                      family = binomial(link = "logit"))
```

    v. describe in your words which model is the best in explaining the variance in accuracy  
```{r}
anova(model1_binom,model2_binom,model3_binom,model4_binom)
```
Model 1 has a significantly higher BIC and AIC than the rest. We can therefore 
conclude including pas as predictor of right_answer is key for explaining
the variance in the data. 

Currently the choice is between model2, model3, model4. So I suggest we do a
cross-validation test to test the generalisability of the models. 

*Cross-Validation*
```{r}
pacman::p_load(caret)
#sample 
rand_sample <- createDataPartition(df_exp $ right_answer, p = 0.8, list = FALSE) 
#training 
train_df <- df_exp[rand_sample,]
#test 
test_df <- df_exp[-rand_sample,]
```

```{r}
#Train on train_df
cv_model2 <- glmer(right_answer ~ task + pas + (1|subject), data = train_df,
                      family = binomial(link = "logit")) 
cv_model3 <- glmer(right_answer ~ pas + (1|subject), data = train_df,
                      family = binomial(link = "logit"))
cv_model4 <- glmer(right_answer ~ pas*task + (1|subject), data = train_df,
                      family = binomial(link = "logit"))
```

```{r}
#Predict
predictions2 <- predict(cv_model2, test_df, type = "response")
predictions3 <- predict(cv_model3, test_df, type = "response")
predictions4 <- predict(cv_model4, test_df, type = "response")
#Turn into binary response
prediction_bin2 <- if_else(predictions2 > 0.5, 1, 0)
prediction_bin3 <- if_else(predictions3 > 0.5, 1, 0)
prediction_bin4 <- if_else(predictions4 > 0.5, 1, 0)

#append predicted values to test_df
test_df <- test_df %>% 
  mutate(pred_val2 = as.factor(prediction_bin2), pred_val3 = as.factor(prediction_bin3), pred_val4 = as.factor(prediction_bin4))

```


```{r}
#Confusion Matrix for model2
confusionMatrix(data=test_df$pred_val2, reference = test_df$right_answer)
```

```{r}
#Confusion Matrix for model3
confusionMatrix(data=test_df$pred_val3, reference = test_df$right_answer)
```

**sum up**
As all models have exactly the same accuracy we could continue with doing k-fold
cross-validation. But for now I'll just argue that we care more about true-negative rate.
It would be awful to correcly classify a person with tumor but even worse to miss
diagnose someone as false-negative which result in death due to lack of treatment.
I know the analogy doesn't quite fit in this experiment but I need some way to choose. ;) 

model4 shows the best true-negative-rate and will therefore be chosen as the final model.
